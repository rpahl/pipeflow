Description: A lightweight yet powerful framework for composing, combining and
    modifying custom data analysis pipelines. Correctness of pipeline is
    verified at definition time. Common parameters can be set simultaneously
    for all analysis steps. Dependencies among steps are tracked automatically
    and can be used to re-run only steps that are affected by parameter changes.
