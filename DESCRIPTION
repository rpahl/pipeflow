Description: A lightweight yet powerful framework for building robust
    data analysis pipelines. With 'pipeflow', you initialize a pipeline
    with your dataset and construct your workflow step by step by seamlessly
    adding R functions. Modify, remove, or insert steps at any stage while
    'pipeflow' ensures the integrity and correctness of your pipeline.
    Designed to help you focus on the 'what' rather than the 'how', this
    package simplifies the implementation of complex workflows, making
    even large-scale data analysis projects manageable, adaptable, and
    reusable with ease.
