Description: Simple yet flexible framework for composing, combining and
    modifying custom data analysis pipelines. Correctness of pipelines is
    verified at definition time. In nonlinear pipelines, dependencies among
    analysis steps are tracked and can be used to re-run only steps that
    are affected by changes.
