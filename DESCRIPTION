Description: A lightweight yet powerful framework for composing, combining
    and modifying custom data analysis pipelines. The correctness of a
    pipeline is verified at definition time. Parameters at all pipeline steps
    or the steps themselves can be modified, removed or inserted at any time.
    Dependencies among steps are tracked and verified automatically and
    used to re-run only steps that are affected by parameter changes,
    similar to the `make` utility.
