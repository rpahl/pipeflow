Description: A lightweight yet powerful framework for creating data
    analysis pipelines. You build your pipelines simply by defining a
    sequence of R functions and 'pipeflow' takes care of tracking
    dependencies among steps and managing all the analysis parameters.
    The framework is easy to get started with for the typical R user, but
    also provides advanced features to enable complex workflows.
