Description: A lightweight yet powerful framework for building robust data
    analysis pipelines. With 'pipeflow', you initialize a pipeline with your
    dataset and construct workflows step by step by adding R functions.
    You can modify, remove, or insert steps and parameters at any stage,
    while 'pipeflow' ensures the pipeline's integrity.
    Overall, this package offers a beginner-friendly framework that simplifies
    and streamlines the development of data analysis pipelines by making
    them modular, intuitive, and adaptable.
