R Data Analysis Workflows with Pipelines

TODO:
- add time column to pipeline
- create own data table class holding the pipeline with better printing,
    - e.g.: instead of <function[1]> print the function with its arguments or its number of arguments based on some threhshold, e.g. function(a, b) shown as
    function(a, b) and more than that as function[3]
    - print parameters and dependencies as in the container package
