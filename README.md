# pipeflow <img src="man/figures/logo.png" alt="logo" align="right" width="163" height="121"/>

A lightweight yet powerful framework for building robust data analysis
pipelines. With `pipeflow`, you initialize a pipeline with your dataset
and construct workflows step by step simply by adding R functions. You
can modify, remove, or insert steps and parameters at any stage, while
`pipeflow` ensures the pipelineâ€™s integrity.

Thanks to its intuitive interface, using `pipeflow` quickly pays off in
the beginning while in the long run will help you to keep a clear and
structured overview of your project.
