# pipeflow
R Data Analysis Workflows with Pipelines

TODO:
- rename .data to data
- enable paralellel execution of independent pipeline steps, easy case being the data split
- create container around function to improve printing, e.g. instead of <function[1]> print the
    function with its arguments or its number of arguments based on some threshold,
    e.g. function(a, b) shown as function(a, b) and more than that as function[3]
