`pipeflow` is an intuitive yet powerful framework for building and running data processing pipelines. Whether you're working in scientific computing, machine learning (AI), or statistical reporting, `pipeflow` adapts seamlessly to any scenario—from small exploratory analyses to complex production workflows.

Since `pipeflow` pipelines are essentially sequences of R functions, they’re easy to learn and can be used interactively by typical R users. Advanced features like dynamic branching and self-modifying pipelines provide additional flexibility for more complex workflows.

### Why use `pipeflow`

* Easy to learn yet powerful for complex workflows
* Automatically manages function dependencies
* Promotes standardized, reproducible analysis
* Simplifies error handling, debugging, and reusability


### Key features

* *Flexible Application:* Use interactively or programmatically in R
* *Dependency Management:* Dependencies checked at definition, ensuring reliable workflows
* *Comprehensive Logging:* Logs each step, with customizable logger options
* *Parameter Control:* Easily view and adjust all function parameters in one place
* *Modular Composition:* Modify, extend, and combine pipelines effortlessly
* *Intelligent Execution:* Skip steps already up-to-date, similar to `make`
* *Visualization:* View pipelines in both tabular and graphical formats

### Advanced features

* *Dynamic Branching:* Apply the same pipeline to multiple datasets seamlessly
* *Self-Modifying:* Pipelines can adapt and modify themselves at runtime


### Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("pipeflow")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("rpahl/pipeflow")
```


### Usage

```{r}
library(pipeflow)
```
