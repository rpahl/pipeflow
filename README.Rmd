A lightweight yet powerful framework for building robust data analysis pipelines.
With `pipeflow`, you initialize a pipeline with your dataset and construct your workflow
step by step by seamlessly adding R functions. Modify, remove, or insert steps at
any stage while `pipeflow` ensures the integrity and correctness of your pipeline.

Designed to help you focus on the *what* rather than the *how*, this package simplifies
the implementation of complex workflows, making even large-scale data analysis projects
manageable, adaptable, and reusable over time.

### Why use `pipeflow`

* Easy to learn yet powerful for complex workflows
* Automatically manages function dependencies
* Promotes standardized, reproducible analysis
* Simplifies error handling, debugging, and reusability


### Key features

* *Flexible Application:* Use interactively or programmatically in R
* *Dependency Management:* Dependencies checked at definition, ensuring reliable workflows
* *Comprehensive Logging:* Logs each step, with customizable logger options
* *Parameter Control:* Easily view and adjust all function parameters in one place
* *Modular Composition:* Modify, extend, and combine pipelines effortlessly
* *Intelligent Execution:* Skip steps already up-to-date, similar to `make`
* *Visualization:* View pipelines in both tabular and graphical formats

### Advanced features

* *Dynamic Branching:* Apply the same pipeline to multiple datasets seamlessly
* *Self-Modifying:* Pipelines can adapt and modify themselves at runtime


### Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("pipeflow")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("rpahl/pipeflow")
```


### Usage

```{r}
library(pipeflow)
```
